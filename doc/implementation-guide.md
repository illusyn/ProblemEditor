# Template Hierarchy Implementation Guide

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive solution for the Math Problem Editor with a focus on adding template hierarchy capabilities. The implementation addresses several key issues that were present in the original code:

1. The question formatting in LaTeX output was broken, showing "Question:0" instead of the actual question
2. Font was too small in the preview and zoom didn't work properly
3. LaTeX template had structural issues with formatting commands
4. The template hierarchy lacked a clear approach for slots/sub-templates

## Key Improvements

### 1. Template Hierarchy System

The template hierarchy system now follows a slot-based approach where:

- Templates consist of multiple "slots" (title, description, equations, question)
- Each slot can be filled with simple content or another sub-template
- The UI allows creation of problems using these templates
- Template selection dialog allows choosing different template types

### 2. LaTeX Rendering Fixes

- Fixed the question formatting by using `#TEXT#` placeholders instead of Python's formatting
- Improved the LaTeX template with proper font sizing and margins
- Added template constants for different problem components

### 3. Preview Improvements

- Fixed zoom functionality to properly change the size of the preview
- Increased the base DPI for better text clarity
- Added proper error handling with log files

### 4. UI Enhancements

- Added a Templates menu with different template types
- Created a template creation dialog with different slots
- Implemented UI components for sub-template selection

## Implementation Structure

The implementation is split across several files:

1. **constants.py**: Contains templates, default configurations, and constants
2. **markdown_parser.py**: Converts markdown to LaTeX with the template hierarchy
3. **problem_editor.py**: Main editor with UI and functionality
4. **ui_components.py**: Reusable UI dialogs including template and slot dialogs
5. **config_manager.py**: Manages configuration settings
6. **error_logger.py**: Handles error logging
7. **editor_config.json**: Configuration file

## How to Use Templates

1. **Basic Templates**:
   - Use the Templates menu to insert pre-defined templates
   - Available templates: Basic Problem, Two Equation Problem, Problem with Image

2. **Custom Templates**:
   - Use "Create from Template..." dialog to build a custom problem
   - Select template type: basic, two_equations, image, or multiple_choice
   - Fill in the slots with your content

3. **Modifying Templates**:
   - Edit the template constants in constants.py to create new templates
   - Add new template types to the UI in problem_editor.py

## Working with Slots

The slot system provides flexibility in how problems are constructed:

1. **Simple Slots**:
   - Basic content like text or a single equation
   - Edited directly in the template dialog

2. **Sub-Template Slots**:
   - Can contain another template
   - Selected from available templates list

3. **Slot Dialog**:
   - Opens when editing complex slot content
   - Provides a dedicated editor for each slot type

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a foundation that can be extended in several ways:

1. **More Template Types**:
   - Add support for more specialized math problem types
   - Implement templates for different grade levels or topics

2. **Dynamic Template Loading**:
   - Load templates from external files
   - Allow user to save custom templates

3. **Enhanced Preview**:
   - Add real-time preview updates
   - Support for interactive elements in templates

4. **Better Slot Management**:
   - Add/remove slots on the fly
   - Reorder slots in templates

## Conclusion

This implementation creates a flexible template hierarchy system that allows for the composition of complex math problems from reusable components. The slot-based approach makes it easy to create and modify templates while maintaining a consistent structure.
